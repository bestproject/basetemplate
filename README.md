# Joomla! base theme
A Joomla! base template that can be used to create custom templates for Bootstrap 4. It contains a basic files structure as well as template overrides to match Boostrap 4 syntax. And Webpack Encore configured as assets building system. 
This isn't a complete framework like many out there. This is just a starter template created to build either a landing page or a big news portal depending on your needs without a need to setup your environment over and over again. 
It saves your time but also gives you a possibility to build lightweight websites with good Google Insights score.
